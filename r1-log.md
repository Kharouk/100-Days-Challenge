**Today's Progress Report**

Currently setting up my challenge. Have a bootcamp interview coming up that requires me to know problem-solving and a bit of ruby. Will work on that today. Working on website's comment section.

Nervous to begin challenge. But excited to start pushing myself. It's all about commitment.

**Today's Progress Report**: Started a new project, hoping to finish tomorrow. Cryptocurrency Portfolio App that tracks personal investment and current information on the market. <br>

### R1D4.5 - August 3 2018
**Today's Progress Report**: Somehow didn't notice that the years before were all 3018. No I'm not from the year 3000 so unfortunately that was changed. Today was progress on the portfolio app. I also got myself a Raspberry Pi as a sort of congratulations to myself for getting into Makers Academy. <br />
**Thoughts**: The anxiety is still there. I'm having trouble feeling relaxed so it's good that I have work to occupy my thoughts. <br />

### R1D9 - August 10 2018
As said on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlexKharouk/): #100DaysOfCode D9 brings the conclusion of challenges. Throughout the week I was faced with increasingly difficult problems. I felt I was thrown into the deep end since before I stuck to code-alongs online. But I made it through! Feeling like a smarter #codenewbie.

### R1D10 - August 11 2018
Saturday, the day of a bit of rest and a bit of code. Gone further with the Treehouse Ruby course. Set up shop in both Hackerrank and Exercism websites. But got to spend quality time with my partner, which was probably the highlight of my day. Until tomorrow!

### R1D11 - August 12 2018
Sunday, fun day. Enjoyed the calmness of the day. Almost didn't code but decided to anyways. Feels great to have done an hour of my crypto project. Tomorrow I will be back to a several-hour coding session!

### R1D12 - August 13 2018
It's weird writing this after a long day of learning/coding/working. So exhausted but glad to have completed the skeleton version of my [Crypto app](http://www.cryptofolio.icu). However upset about the bugs that came with deployment. Also got to 6 kyu on Codewars!

### R1D13 - August 28 2018
Debated restarting. Decided not to due to productive responsibility. Worked on a machine learning app using brain.js and brad travery's tutorial video. Loved it since it was my first step into ML. Came back from a long, yet beautiful trip. Lost my laptop on the way back. D:!!! Sad.

### R1D14 - August 29 2018
My laptop is probably stolen by now. More sad. Worked on pair programming and TDD on FizzBuzz. Was nice to meet a fellow student from my cohort. Eager to begin course. Feeling a lot of anxiety over it too.

### R1D15 - August 30 2018
Completed pre-course work. Worked on Rails track on Codecademy. Did some more studying on Ruby.

### R1D16 - August 31 2018
Wes Bos Javascript30 course. Worked on CSS variables and JS. Was fun to learn about CSS again. Feel like I've been focused only on programming/back-end languages.
