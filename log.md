# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--- **Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app. -->

<!--- **Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. -->

### Day 1: July 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress** 

Well It's a big day. I can finally be a part of a movement that I've been watching from a distance for quite some time. I started learning to code exactly two months ago. Since then I've been watching tutorials, reading books, and coding along various instructors from all different platforms. Now it's time to take off the training wheels. Here is Day One.

Working on my blog website done with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I've been learning Ruby on platforms like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby), [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/topic:ruby) as well as books like [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) and [Why's (Poignant) Guide.](https://poignant.guide/) Wanted to create a blog without too much support, and Jekyll was a perfect fit for a beginner like me. 

Today I am adding a comment section to my blog, as I want people to be able to share with me what they are thinking about my blogposts. 

**Thoughts**

Nervous about starting this challenge. In some weeks I will be travelling to Greenland and will not have access to my computer. So the week before I will work two hours a day on a project, rather than the standard one hour. This will hopefully make up for lost days.

### Day 2: July 31, 2018 

**Today's Progress** 

Cutting through the Ruby course on Treehouse. It feels like a massive messy jungle, that course, mostly because I'm not really enjoying the instructor's teaching style. However it's hard to find modern Ruby guides. I'm also needing to push myself through it because tomorrow I have an interview at Maker's Academy! I'm excited because I hear such positive things about the school, and I really hope I can get in for the October cohort. 

Got past 3000 points on Treehouse! Feeling good about that. Also so close to reaching 100 on codewars! Just one more kata tonight and I'm there. Planted my first real tree with the forest app as well!

**Thoughts**

Worried about tomorrow's interview but I think I can show them how motivated I am. Really looking forward to it. Not so happy with the amount of work I put into studying but it was a crazy outdoor kind of day. I did hit some wild achievements though!
