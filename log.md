# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 30, 2018 

**Today's Progress** 

Well It's a big day. I can finally be a part of a movement that I've been watching from a distance for quite some time. I started learning to code exactly two months ago. Since then I've been watching tutorials, reading books, and coding along various instructors from all different platforms. Now it's time to take off the training wheels. Here is Day One.

Working on my blog website done with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I've been learning Ruby on platforms like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby), [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/topic:ruby) as well as books like [Learn to Program](https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) and [Why's (Poignant) Guide.](https://poignant.guide/) Wanted to create a blog without too much support, and Jekyll was a perfect fit for a beginner like me. 

Today I am adding a comment section to my blog, as I want people to be able to share with me what they are thinking about my blogposts. 

**Thoughts**

Nervous about starting this challenge. In some weeks I will be travelling to Greenland and will not have access to my computer. So the week before I will work two hours a day on a project, rather than the standard one hour. This will hopefully make up for lost days.

### Day 2: July 31, 2018 

**Today's Progress** 

Cutting through the Ruby course on Treehouse. It feels like a massive messy jungle, that course, mostly because I'm not really enjoying the instructor's teaching style. However it's hard to find modern Ruby guides. I'm also needing to push myself through it because tomorrow I have an interview at Maker's Academy! I'm excited because I hear such positive things about the school, and I really hope I can get in for the October cohort. 

Got past 3000 points on Treehouse! Feeling good about that. Also so close to reaching 100 on codewars! Just one more kata tonight and I'm there. Planted my first real tree with the forest app as well!

**Thoughts**

Worried about tomorrow's interview but I think I can show them how motivated I am. Really looking forward to it. Not so happy with the amount of work I put into studying but it was a crazy outdoor kind of day. I did hit some wild achievements though!

### Day 3: August 1st, 2018 

**Today's Progress** 

Went through a technical interview which I passed with flying colors. I am know a new student at Makers Academy in London. Afterwards I worked on a new blogpost about Modules and Mixins and taking a break. However began organising Rails to start a new project. Hopefully I will accomplish it tomorrow. **A cryptocurrency portfolio**.

**Thoughts**

Feeling golden but a bit tired. I'm happy with my progress but I should relax before my pre-course begins to avoid too much burnout.

### Day 4: August 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**

Actual code! Code that is awkward but outside-the-box. I started the day with a press of a digital button, and a timer counts down from 120 minutes. I then began a new rails project locally. A first for me. Then I began my application, that uses Devise, Bootstrap, Rails, and yes a tutorial but it's something new. And something I wouldn't mind showing on a portfolio. It's still young, but it's a simple app that uses an API to display information on selected Cryptocurrency. You can then keep track of coins and also input how much money you've invested into the coin, and whether or not you're profiting from it. 

**Thoughts**

I had to push through to code today. I had such a nice day yesterday that for some reason I felt quite sick today. You ever get those thoughts where you feel like something bad is gonna happen? Yeah, one of those days. Almost wanted to just crawl into bed but pushed through! Also very hot today in London, England. I'm more of a cold, cloudy weather kind of guy.

### Day 5: August 6th, 2018

**Today's Progress** 

Feeling good, feeling great. Today was my first day doing the Makers Academy pre-course. I honestly felt like I did a week's worth of work in a day. And technically I did. It's a four week pre-course and the first week is dedicated to learning the command line and version control. Which... I kinda did today. My assignments were to figure out the command line, use git and github (also know the difference), but more importantly, the challenge we had to do was to solve a murder mystery game using only the terminal. Really fun! 

**Thoughts**

I was gone for a couple of days and didn't have access to my computer. I think that I'm going to add a new rule. If I am travelling for more than 15 minutes then I am legally aloud to leave.. this challenge. I'm feeling much better after my getaway though. Really rouch times before but it looks like things are a tad better. Still nervous about my future but I think working on Makers Academy work is making me feel mentally strong. It also helped that I went to the gym before I started my day!

### Day 6: August 7th, 2018

**Today's Progress** 

Day two of the pre-course and I've begun working through the Ruby material. I've read four chapters that introduce the concept and theory behind programming, and helping me understand better the things I know about the language. Today I was able to solve both the Fibonacci and the FizzBuzz challenge without too much outside support, so that's got me reeling with excitement. I think it marked the first time I felt like I was doing alright with learning how to code. 

**Thoughts**

Really liking Ruby. I hope that the knowledge I get learning it will really help when I go off and learn other languages. I'm still curious about Python and Go. Also want to learn C# for whenever I get into game programming. Was glad I was able to to write a blog detailing my journey so far. Link is below. 

**Link(s) to work** Nothing to show since I did it through Maker's repository.

### Day 8: August 9th, 2018

**Today's Progress** 

Spent the last couple of days going through the pre-course. Solving the challenges one by one. Even though the time to debug each challenge is taking longer and longer. But my determination to solve each challenge increases tenfold. I didn't write a log yesterday but believe me, future me, that I worked just as hard. 

**Thoughts**

Every waking hour is spent investing into my new career. I can't stop. It's really invigorating feeling this passion, however I should be aware of burning out. Honestly, when someone goes completely sober, it's impressive how much work can fill up the hours of the day.

### Day 9: August 10th, 2018

**Today's Progress**

Friday! My Forest Pomodoro App tells me I worked 7 hours and 21 minutes going through the challenges set by the bootcamp. In that time, I had my hardest challenge yet. I'm still new to problem solving but a lot of the challenges had me breaking them down, putting pen on paper to sort out conditionals, then finally solving it. The problem today was so difficult I finally had to announce and give up. Asked for help from my cohort. However, I was so anxious that the problem wasn't solved, I couldn't wait. I ended up missing an important part in the error message and found the mistake I made. I felt so inspired to have solved it, I want to write about the process. 

**Thoughts**

I think my progress report today was more thoughtful than about projects, so I think I shouldn't repeat myself. But today it has been raining in London all day. I missed that. I realised today I do better work when it's raining. Rain delights me. Heat, not so much.

### Day 10: August 11th, 2018

**Today's Progress**

Woohoo. I'm now 10% into this challenge. Today I took it easy. I made some progress through the Ruby Treehouse track since I've completed all the work needed for my pre-course. I then signed up and begun solving beginner challenges in both Hackerrank and Exercism.io since both are recommended in the programming world. I wanted to work on my cryptocurrency app, but instead decided to spend some needed quality time with my partner, playing Scrabble in the park.

**Thoughts**

Chilled out. Relaxed. Tranquilo. Took it easy on myself, only coding in the morning whilst the partner was still asleep. Didn't want to overwork on the Saturday. However worried about this trip I'm doing next week. Hope I can get in a lot of work Monday and Tuesday so I don't feel too guilty travelling without coding. However I did get myself a Sandi Metz book, so at least I have reading sorted!

**Links**: Meh. Nothing to post. 

**Twitter Update**: Haven't posted anything for today. It's a Saturday. Gimme a break! 

### Day 11: August 12th, 2018

**Today's Progress**

Almost didn't code today! Instead I focused back onto my crypto rails app, and learned a bit more about authentication and what pages can be seen by what users. I also tidied up some of the UI to make it look more like an authentic product.

**Thoughts**

Was really trying to convince myself to just relax today. I almost decided to just relax the night away until I told myself I'd feel better if I just get an hour of code into my day. Obviously feel better. Made a bit of a push with the app. Happy with it, even if it's done through a vague tutorial. Proud of sticking with it though.

### Day 12: August 13th, 2018

**Today's Progress**

Phew. Finally finished version 1.0 of my cryptocurrency app but holy crap is deploying a nightmare when you have no idea what's going on. Deployed to heroku but am struggling getting everything working. It's such a different playing field compared to development/local servers.

**Thoughts**

Had a successful day of coding, but I'm getting tired of Ruby! I feel like whenever I start a Ruby kata or face a problem in Ruby my heart just starts accelerating. Really want to step back and go back to learning Javascript. But I do have a trip coming up, so I'm not too worried about it.

### Day 13: August 28th, 2018

**Today's Progress**

As soon as I got back from my trip, I noticed that Brad Traversy released a quick tutorial about machine learning in JavaScript. I'm super interested in both JS and ML, so I worked on the tutorial and then the app. It was really cool to use since it was my first initial step into Machine Learning. I'm really hoping to dwell further into it, and maybe eventually use ML for a project in Makers Academy.

**Thoughts**

There has been a big jump in regards to dates between logs. This is because I was away on holiday to Greenland and Iceland, which was a spectacular trip. I really enjoyed it. I debated restarting the 100 days but I really think I'd be more productive if I just keep the current ticker going up. It may be cheating but I know that it'll be more beneficial for me commitment wise. However, I lost my laptop on the plane and this is killing me. I really hope I get it back. It feels like such a stupid mistake.

### Day 14: August 29th, 2018

**Today's Progress**

Had my first remote pairing session! Together we worked on the fizzbuzz challenge, however we had to think like beginners who've never attempted the challenge since we were also creating RSpec tests for it. It was challenging yet fun, and it was great to finally meet someone from my cohort. This only gets me more pumped for the beginning of the course, however it feels like just yesterday I got in. Now it's almost beginning and soon it will end! 

**Thoughts**

Still missing my laptop but have decided to buy my partner's 2011 macbook that she was going to sell anyways. I wanted to install Linux on it and fiddle around with learning Kali or Fedora. I don't know if it'll be worth it (probably not) but I'll try it out anyways. I already purchased an SSD drive for it so hopefully it'll run faster than it does now (takes like 10 minutes to just open up terminal..)

### Day 15: August 30th, 2018

**Today's Progress**

Wrapping up the pre-course for Makers. Can't believe I've pretty much finished it all. I worked on a few more ruby challenges, updated the instagram blog I introduced yesterday and spent the day trying to find dedicated time between watching Mr. Robot, and doing my studies.

**Thoughts**

Posting this a day later is annoying and I hope I can find the time in the future to keep this daily, not every other day.

### Day 16: August 31st, 2018

**Today's Progress**

Worked on day 3 of Javascript30 with Wes Bos, using CSS Variables with JavaScript. It was interesting for me since I didn't know CSS used variables and it was difficult to get used to that. Will now spend some time watching Byteconf React on Twitch and see if I can get more information into my tired mind.

**Thoughts**

Tired but today is officially my last weekday before I begin Makers. It's been a crazy month and I can't wait to begin at the school. I only hope I can perform well and get a job soon after I graduate.

### Day 17: September 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**

Happy September 1st! So happy Summer is ending and the season that makes me cheerful is beginning. Today I worked on a lot of things.Did a JavaScript 30 challenge - day 4. Learned about arrays with the Bos. I also completed almost 50 parts of the Ruby track on Treehouse, which means I am almost finished my first track! I think the monthly subscription is finally paying off. Still didn't like the teacher but now will be working on Sinatra with another teacher. I also followed a tutorial to learn more TDD, converting Roman Numerals into numbers.

**Thoughts**

Today is the last Saturday before I embark on a bootcamp journey. I have no clue how I'm going to be like in the upcoming weeks, but as you know, I'm *excited*!
